# Project 3 - *Jelp*

**Jelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
- [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Customized launch screen (Attempted animated Launch Screen)
- [x] Customized detail view screen with map image
- [x] pin annotation with touch segue to overview description
- [x] Yelp Icon
- [x] filter for restaurant results
- [x] Radius filter should expand to current location

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Implemtation of current locale GPS instead of preset filler
2. creating animated loading indicator
